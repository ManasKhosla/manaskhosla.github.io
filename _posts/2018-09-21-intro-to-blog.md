## He always wanted to blogâ€¦

Well, I wanted to start with 'I' instead of 'He', but it just sounded more dramatic ðŸ˜† .

Now ever since I came to know about this(I was in school then), I wanted to blog. But I could never figure out what to write. Now I'm in college, got a lot of stuff I can talk and write about. So basically I will be blabbing about my studies, new tech interests of mine and also my favorite movies and TV shows. And yes I know a guy who knows a guy who has a Netflix subscription, so basically got no worries.

I know blogs are old school, but still thereâ€™s something about the classics. Classics are timeless so will these blogs be. And now to end with direct quoted words from â€˜The Lion Kingâ€™
