### Some pretext
So this started with me being wanting to develop a new blog theme. I had explored jekyll in past but used it as secondary thing. But this time I thought let's try jekyll out with native github actions only. Anyhow I needed an environment with jekyll installed but didn't want to go through hassle of installing it again. Last time I installed ruby on my system it took ages to remove the installation. So initially I needed a docker type thing but now docker as its too tedious to build everytime and takes alot of space which it gets a little tough to control. So best option which wouldn't cause me money(Yes, talking about cloud) was trying a native good old school VM.

So I installed VM on my PC and and installed ```Crunchbangplusplus OS``` which is a lightweight Debian based OS. And once I installed I instantly recognized the flaws and why many people don't do it.

First of all, working inside a VM is very yukk(that's the only word I could think of to describe it).
