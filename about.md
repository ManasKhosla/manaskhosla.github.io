I'm an Associate Engineer at Amdocs. Also a competitive coder and a part-time blogger who loves watching movies and cooking sometimes among other stuff. I also like experimenting with new things in tech. 


I love automating stuff and I usually dabble in python, java and bash. But maybe its time to try some new things. That's why I thought I will try implementation of ruby based blog generation framework - jekyll on github to automate rendering pages for me. So I can focus on my thoughts rather than how to present it or write it. This is kind of a relaxing place for me so I think I'll keep it ```simple, clean and minimalistic```. Less distractions!


This is my place where I write my musings... well sometimes atleast! I built this blog in my college second year while trying out web development for the first time. So basically this helped me eliminate web development or atleast basic web dev with vanilla javascript and static pages as my first career choice... But still I had fun doing it, and sometimes debugging also, however painful it was, still it was an honest days work for me at that time. So I thought maybe I'll revisit it again and hence doing a complete overhaul of the whole thing.


Well that's probably it, got nothing more to say for now. See ya!
